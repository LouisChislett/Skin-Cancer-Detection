# Skin-Cancer-Detection
This repo contains an attempt at the [Kaggle ISIC 2024 Skin Cancer Detection Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/isic-2024-challenge/overview)

In this notebook I build a CNN which takes image and tabular data as inputs, concatenates the layers and then outputs the probability of an image being skin cancer or not, which was used for prediction.

Note that to run the provided notebook you would need to download the data, found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/isic-2024-challenge/data), and place it in a file called "\Data".
